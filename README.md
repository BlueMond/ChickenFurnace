# ChickenFurnace

A SpigotMC plugin that allows you to feed chickens smeltable materials, that they will then slowly process and pop out the result of one by one. Items they are processing will be displayed in their custom name.

Chickens actively smelting products will be saved in the data file for the plugin, and be loaded on chunk loads, and unloaded on chunk unloads.
